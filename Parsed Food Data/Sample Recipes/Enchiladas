Ingredients: [1 package ground chicken thighs, or any ground meat, 1 package ground chicken liver, 2 eggs, 4-6 flour tortillas, 1 chopped tomato, 2 packages of dried enchilada sauce, 2 cans tomato paste, 3 /12 cups water, 2 cups grated cheese, 1 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp Cheyenne pepper, 1 dollop of sour cream (optional), 1 dollop of guacamole (optional)]

Instructions:
Brown the ground chicken and chicken livers with the eggs.
While the meat is browning put together the sauce by adding the water, tomato paste and seasoning packets together in a sauce pan. Simmer for about 2 minutes and remove from heat.
Add chili powder, salt and Cheyenne pepper to the meat. Mix well. Once the meat is browned and seasoned remove from the heat.
Add the diced tomato's, half the cheese and about half the sauce to the meat mixture.
Heat the tortillas in some tin foil over a fire or in a skillet over a stove. If you are making these in your RV or at home, you can use a microwave for about 30 seconds.
Once the tortillas are slightly heated, take each one and add the meat mixture to the tortilla. Fold the tortilla and place in Dutch oven or oven pan if baking these in an oven. Repeat for each tortilla. Spread the remaining sauce
Sprinkle top with some more cheese.
If using a Dutch oven, place about 17 pieces of charcoal on the top and 8 pieces on the bottom to attain a temperature of about 350 degrees for about 25 minutes.
In an oven, cook for 25 minutes at 350° Fahrenheit.
