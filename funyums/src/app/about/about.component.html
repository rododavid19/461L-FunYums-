      <h3>DATA AND TOOLS</h3>
      <p>
          For our tools, we will be using Angular for our front-end. This will allow us to create our front-end webpages in a simple and 
          intuitive manner using different components. For our application, we will create different components for each page, for example, 
          one for a recipe page, one for our about page, etc. For the deployment of our application, we will be using Google Cloud Platform, 
          which will allow us to easily move our app to live production that can be viewed by anyone on the internet.  Another reason for using 
          this is that the majority of the team has experience with launching apps to GCP. For testing, we used Karma with Jasmine. 
          This allowed us to quickly deploy JavaScript tests in a real browser which includes a native debugger.
          
          <br> <br>
          The primary data source we are using is the Yummly API: <a href="https://github.com/rododavid19/461L-FunYums-">https://developer.yummly.com/documentation.</a> 
          <br>
        
          This API provides recipe search features allowing us to obtain ingredients, pictures, step-by-step instructions, 
          and nutritional facts for a given recipe by using HTTP requests and parsing the resulting JSON data.
